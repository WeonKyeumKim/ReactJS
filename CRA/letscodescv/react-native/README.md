# Other notes
- After npm install new packages react-native-elements, in emulator you might get: Can't find variable: self
 - Try force version as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52269560/react-native-expo-cant-find-variable-self
 But get: 
  Error running `xcrun simctl openurl booted exp://localhost:19000`: An error was encountered processing the command (domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain, code=60):
  The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Operation timed out
  Operation timed out

You can ignore this. It is still working.
